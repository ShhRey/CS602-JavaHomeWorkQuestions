## Coursework Structure

The codes in this repository are added in different phases, corresponding to homework assignments as and when assigned by Prof. Hsu Donald. The assignments may include both group and individual questions.
More assignments and their code files will be added as the course progresses.

## Running the Codes

These Java programs are developed in the Eclipse IDE and follow the workspace folder structure. If you're unfamiliar with Java or Eclipse, here's a simple guide to run these programs in your own environment:

1. **Install Eclipse IDE**: Download and install the Eclipse IDE from [the official website](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
3. **Import Project into Eclipse**:
   - Open Eclipse and select `File` > `Import`.
   - Choose `Existing Projects into Workspace` under the `General` folder.
   - Navigate to the cloned repository folder and select the project to import.
   - Ensure the project is checked and click `Finish`.

4. **Running a Program**:
   - In the Eclipse IDE, navigate to the `src` folder in the Project Explorer.
   - Find the `.java` file you wish to run, right-click on it, and select `Run As` > `Java Application`.

For those who are new to Java, it's recommended to familiarize yourself with basic Java syntax and concepts. Various online resources and tutorials can help you get started with Java programming and Eclipse IDE.
